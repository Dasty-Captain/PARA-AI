# Post-Archion Product and Technology Roadmap (Enterprise Focus)

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the revised post-Archion product and technology roadmap for The Dimension Company, with a strong focus on the needs of tier 1 enterprise customers in the manufacturing sector. This roadmap is designed to achieve a total of $10M in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and position the company for a strategic acquisition by Autodesk for over $200M.

This roadmap is based on the feedback received and is focused on delivering high-impact products that will create a strong "data moat" and make The Dimension Company an attractive acquisition target for Autodesk.

The roadmap consists of a sequence of four new products that will be built on top of our core technology stack:

*   **Universal CAD Data Platform (STEP-GOT + Search):** A foundational platform for managing and searching all CAD data.
*   **AI-Powered BOM Management:** A tool for automatically generating, managing, and optimizing Bills of Materials (BOMs).
*   **Automated DFM Analysis:** A tool for automatically analyzing designs for manufacturability (DFM).
*   **Generative Design for Tooling and Fixtures:** A tool for automatically creating designs for tooling and fixtures.

## 2. Core Technology Stack

Our technology stack is designed to create a virtuous cycle of data acquisition, model improvement, and product innovation. It consists of three core components:

*   **Data Pipeline:** A scalable system for collecting, processing, and enriching proprietary data from our products and partners. This data will be used to train our AI models and will be a key strategic asset for acquisition.
*   **aGFL (agentic Geometry Figure Library):** A data-efficient, neural CAD foundation model for Text-to-CAD. aGFL will be the core of our product design and generation capabilities.
*   **Ontology Agent:** A tool-using agent for CAD-related tasks, powered by a knowledge graph that combines Bill of Materials (BOM), code, and metadata. The Ontology Agent will enable our products to perform complex, multi-step tasks and reason about design and engineering constraints.

## 3. Product Roadmap

### Archion (In CBT)

*   **Product:** An AI-powered interior design tool for 2D-to-3D conversion, FF&E placement, and photorealistic rendering.
*   **Target ARR:** $3M
*   **Strategic Role:** Validate the GTM strategy, establish a beachhead in the interior design market, and begin generating proprietary data.

### Universal CAD Data Platform (Post-Archion MVP 1)

*   **Product:** A foundational platform for managing and searching all CAD data, based on the STEP-GOT data protocol. This will be the cornerstone of our enterprise offering. The platform will provide a unified view of all CAD data, regardless of its source or format.
*   **Target ARR:** $2M
*   **Strategic Role:** Create a new standard for AI-ready CAD data, and position The Dimension Company as a leader in the field. This will be a key strategic asset for acquisition.

### AI-Powered BOM Management (Post-Archion MVP 2)

*   **Product:** A tool for automatically generating, managing, and optimizing Bills of Materials (BOMs). The tool will use our Ontology Agent to understand the relationships between different parts and assemblies, and to automatically update the BOM as the design changes.
*   **Target ARR:** $3M
*   **Strategic Role:** Solve a major pain point for manufacturers and demonstrate the power of our Ontology Agent to automate complex, multi-step tasks.

### Automated DFM Analysis (Post-Archion MVP 3)

*   **Product:** A tool for automatically analyzing designs for manufacturability (DFM). The tool will use our aGFL model to understand the geometry of the design, and our Ontology Agent to reason about manufacturing constraints.
*   **Target ARR:** $1M
*   **Strategic Role:** Help manufacturers to identify and fix potential manufacturing issues early in the design process, which will save them time and money.

### Generative Design for Tooling and Fixtures (Post-Archion MVP 4)

*   **Product:** A tool for automatically creating designs for tooling and fixtures using generative design. The tool will use our aGFL model to generate a wide range of design options, and our Ontology Agent to select the optimal design based on user-defined constraints.
*   **Target ARR:** $1M
*   **Strategic Role:** Help manufacturers to reduce the time and cost of designing and manufacturing tooling and fixtures.

## 6. Strategic Rationale for Autodesk M&A

This revised roadmap is designed to make The Dimension Company an even more irresistible acquisition target for Autodesk. Here's why:

*   **Enterprise Focus:** The new roadmap is highly focused on the needs of tier 1 manufacturers, which is a key market for Autodesk.
*   **Data Moat:** Our products will generate a massive amount of proprietary data on user preferences, product specifications, and design decisions. This data will be invaluable to Autodesk for training their Neural CAD models.
*   **Data-Efficient AI:** Our aGFL model is designed to be data-efficient, which will be a major advantage for Autodesk as they struggle with data scarcity.
*   **Agentic AI:** Our Ontology Agent will demonstrate the power of agentic AI to automate and optimize the design process. This aligns perfectly with Autodesk's strategic focus on agentic AI.
*   **Strategic Fit:** Our focus on the manufacturing sector and our development of a new standard for AI-ready CAD data (STEP-GOT) will make us a highly strategic acquisition for Autodesk.
*   **Financials:** Our target of $10M ARR will make us a financially attractive acquisition target.

By executing on this roadmap, we will not only build a successful business, but also create a company that is strategically vital to the future of Autodesk.
