## Content

1. **Overall Theme**: preparing rapid expansions. Product and technology should be prepared 2026 for rapid expansion.

2. **Cash Flow Events**:
		- **Overall Target**: $416K-550K Monthly Revenue. 6-7M within a year and half. 
	- **#0, 25 4Q) Archion Series(should be main rev. driver)**: 
		- **Object**: From interior teacher to **sketchup and Revit plugin**. 
		- **Key Result**: ==Target $2M by the end of '26==. '26 1Q, Archion should earn $166K(약 2억 4천만원) per month. NEED SALES PIPELINE and B2C plugin and softwares for Archion Canvas.
	- **#1, 26 1Q) 2D->3D CAD agent(general purpose)**: 
		- **Object**: From HD to MHI, Volvo etc. for tier 1 enterprise who has many grey 2D drawing datas. This solution should target, and it's all manual work so far. The market was originally built upon 2D infrastructure, therefore their 3D CAD transformation takes extra cost compared to consumer electronics or automotive industries. **Key Value Proposition**: they can handle 3D workflow seamlessly, ==unlocking 3D workflows without re-training senior 2D drafting expertise==. AutoCAD is typically cited as **holding around 30–40% of the global CAD software market**, and the “AutoCAD and **==AutoCAD LT Family” currently contributes about one quarter of Autodesk’s total revenue==**
		- **Key Result**: $2M ARR 
    - **#2, 26 2Q) Small Parts Design Module**: foundation model as a service
	    - **Object**: **aData**(synthetic data, building solid AI moat) -> **aCAD**(fine-tune & ontology) small parts design. LLMs cannot learn its domain specific language and patter as fast as others. This indicates many things: 
	    - **Key Result**: 
		    - **Ship V1 as paid pilot('26 1Q)**: **aData**(domain specific data and ontology gen, building parametric asset library) -> **aCAD**(AI powered CAD search, gen, edit), 2-3 enterprise pilot start, $500K paid pilot target. 
		    - **Ship V2**: large scale deploy. $500K per enterprise, deploying FMaaS(easy upload, auto data aug, auto train, auto ontology, auto CAD AI), targeting $2-3M until the end of the year. 
		    - **Data Moat**: collect CAD DSL with more than 10M-20M synthetic part samples(geometry, constraint, tags)
    - **#3, 26 2Q) PLM(BOM) + CAD Agent(Orchestration)**
	    - **Object**: T1 enterprise target, PLM-CAD(BOM included) agent that handles complex PLM & CAD workflows. Starting with consumer electronics domain first. 
		- **Key Result**: expect ==$1M ARR== through forming partnership with P&P advisory. PLM and below small parts design module should be initiated almost at the same time. 
    - **#4, 26 3Q) Assembly Module**:
	    - **Object**: ssembly agent that automates **mates/constraints**, **BOM-aware assembly building**, variant handling, interference checks, and export (STEP + enterprise formats). Designed to sit on top of #1 / #2 and increase expansion revenue per customer.
	    - **Key Result**:
		    - ==Assembly v1 (beta) by late ’26 2Q==, with **2 enterprise pilots**.
		    - ==$0.5M ARR run-rate by end of ’26== as an upsell module to PLM/CAD orchestration customers.
		    - Performance bar: **>40% reduction** in assembly modelling time on representative assemblies + **automated interference detection** integrated into review loop.
    - **#5, 26 3Q) Engineering Module**:
	    - **Object**: engineering agent layer for **DFM/DFA checks**, tolerance guidance, materials/process, pre-meshing and processing, and simulation setup assistance (CAE workflow orchestration). If possible, will implement sim based adjustment. 
	    - **Key Result**: 
		    - ==Engineering v1 (alpha) by ’26 3Q==, external beta by ’26 4Q.
		    - ==$0.5M ARR run-rate by end of ’26== through **1–2 paid engineering teams** adding the module.
		    - Outcome bar: **>30% reduction** in iteration loops from design→review and **>80% coverage** of a curated ruleset for manufacturability/engineering checks in the initial domain.

3. Business Milestones
	- **CAD major players connection**: starting from Autodesk(and other players) partnership, projects, investment
	- **Fundraising**: Seed Round($3-4M) -> Series-A($10-20M) -> SPV -> Exit
	- **Domain specific consulting firms partnership**(TIOR, P&P Advisory etc.)
	- **Academic partnership**: MIT CSAILab, Stanford HAI collaboration
	- **PR projects**: 
		- Elon Musk, Korea presidential events, Samsung/Hyundai huge projects ...
		- X Viral Growth
		- Forbes 30 under 30 referral, Fortune 100 targeted 
	- **AI big tech partnerships**: OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI etc.
	- **CAE partnership**: EverySim, Altair(Siemens $10B acquisition), 
	- **Advisory board setup**: including ex-CEO and CTO of Autodesk, needs to define.
	- **Patent portfolio**: started issuing patent, need to prepare exit-ready patent portfolios. 
	- **Small manufacturing firm execution**: establish keyboard parts or other easy-customizable parts design end-to-end manufacturing firm.
	- **Robotics startup partnership**: robotics parts design with aData & aCAD. 
	- **Government grant**: from Korea and the U. S., over $3M-4M

4. **Tech & Product Milestones(time series)**
