 1. **Intro**: this will be your lifetime opportunity, stepping stone to next step, and turning point of a whole time(for both employees and investors.)
2. **Market is huge!** 
	- $20B+ market, 97% of users are annual recurring subscribers, and TOP THREE MAJOR PLAYERS compete in the same market.
	- Autodesk YoY 15-17%
	- Especially, their gross margin rate is nearly 90%, accumulating numerous cash flow, therefore CAD players invest tremendous amount of money in R&D and M&A. 
	- We start from their biggest portion: "**Design**" product family, which accounts for around **50% of Autodesk's revenue**.
	- 97% of Autodesk's customer is ==YEARLY RECURRING CUSTOMER==. Most of them are in tier 1 enterprise, due to its expansive cost. If we build the product through Autodesk plug-in, and assume we take 1% of users, then we'll have at least $5-10M ARR. 

**CAD Giants' gross margin rate**: WOW

2. **M&A is proactive**: 15 M&As within 5 years, MINIMUM $200M, overall $50B
	- **M&A Patterns**: as CAD giants' gross margin rates are 80-90%, they have many supplementary M&A portfolios. 
	- **FOMO**: cases show many FOMOs are going on due to its INTENSIFIED market competition. In very competitive landscape, M&A deals can be crucial, especially for AI technology. Major CAD players are just three: Autodesk, Dassault Systems, and Siemens. Therefore, to keep their competitive edge and with the situation of high cash-flow, M&A made by FOMO is N% of total deals. 

| Year | CAD AI Deals | Year-over-Year Change | YoY Growth % |
| ---- | ------------ | --------------------- | ------------ |
| 2020 | 4 deals      | -                     | -            |

3. **CASE-STUDY**: Many startup M&A deals convince fast growth and high multiple. 
	- [[High-Level CAD AI M&A Patterns_ Revenue → Multiple]]
		- **Pattern 1**: Mature(engineering) + Profitable -> Premium Multiples(15-16x). Example: Altair($10B) and Ansys($35B) very mature and market-dominant player in CAE field. 
		- **Pattern 2(most relivant)**: Growth Stage + Cloud-Native → Ultra-Premium Multiples (25-45x)
		- **Pattern 3**: Niche AI + FDA/Regulatory Integration → Moderate Multiples (5-10x)
		- **Pattern 4(second relivant):** Early Stage + Workflow AI → Strategic Acqui-Hire (Undisclosed)
		- **Pattern 5 (third relivant)**: Proprietary Data + AI Models → Defensive Competitive Moats
		- **Pattern 6**: AI Democratization → Market Expansion Beyond Experts
		- **The premium drivers**: (1) Cloud-native SaaS architecture, (2) AI enabling platform business model transitions, (3) Proprietary training datasets creating competitive moats, and (4) Regulatory clearances (FDA, industry certifications) providing entry barriers.
4. **Autodesk Weakness & Problem of CAD industry**: 
	- **Autodesk's AI Weakness** is not only applied to Autodesk, but to all CAD major players. Even though they have 15+ years of R&D experience, they failed to launch the successful AI product. Following is why. 
	- **Their challenges**: according to Autodesk Chief Scientist and many public sources, 
		- **data shortage**(no enterprise data), because all data they have is their clients' proprietary data
		- unable to scale **industry-specific AI models**, researches stopped at PoC scale,  
		- no **high-quality assets**, 
		- **Data-efficient reasoning system**(AI model that works well on small amount of data)
		- **No agent due to its complexity**: even though they have numerous 
	- ==Need real data in Autodesk Research's papers, showing that they need data-efficient models, synthetic data papers or some statement  that they acknowledge data shortage. etc. ==
5. **Our Strategy**: we have tech, product, and team THEY WANT: 
	- **Enhancing Autodesk's key revenue driver**: Archion, archi-search etc = enhancing fit with Autodesk, providing supplementary features to Revit's pain points. Spacemaker is THE BEST CASE($5-10M Rev, 24-48x Multiple, $240M acquisition). It is exterior + city planning AI, and we are **interior specialized AI, that reinforce Autodesk's monopolistic position.** 
	- **Data pipeline and Dimension foundation model**: aCAD, STEP -> GOT, high quality 
	- **Data-Efficient Agent System**: CAD Ontology powered, knowledge-graph + agentic RAG system. 
	- **Enterprise targeted, high-end quality proprietary data acquisition**: Blyncsy, iCAD, Altair is the **best M&A case for domain-specific proprietary data**. 

| Rank | Product Family        | Primary Products           | FY2025 Revenue |
| ---- | --------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1    | AEC (Revit, Civil3D)  | Revit, Civil 3D, BIM tools | $2.94B         |
| 2    | AutoCAD Family        | AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT        | $1.57B         |
| 3    | Manufacturing         | Inventor, Fusion 360       | $1.19B         |
| 4    | Media & Entertainment | 3ds Max, Maya, etc.        | $315M          |
| 5    | Other                 | Various                    | $118M          |

6. **So, what is [[tech & product roadmap]]**: 
	- **Plug-In First Strategy**: Autodesk's ==97% of users are ANNUAL RECURRING SUBSCRIBERS==, and there are no alternatives. If we make A FEW GOOD ENOUGH solution for enterprises, generating revenue from it is not that hard. 
	- **Core Technology: Data Pipeline + aCAD(CAD Foundation Model project) + Ontology Agent**
		- **Data Pipeline powered by aData**: system that makes sufficient amount of high-quality synthetic data for ontology and fine-tuning. 
		- **aCAD**: Something-to-CAD, industry-specific foundation model. 
		- **Ontology Agent(BOM + Code + Meta Data Combined)**: Tool-use for CAD-related tasks. 
***
	1. **Archion**: fully aligned with Autodesk's demand. 50% of their revenue is from "Design", which heavily relies on Autodesk Revit. Target architecture and interior to increase fit with Autodesk. 
	2. **Ontology powered Search Engine**: connect fragmented assets and data(expansion of Archi-Search) -- need to build internal 3D DB, 
		- **Library Building & Search**: building asset library for agent, that can search all fragmented pieces of data, 3D models, and enterprise info. It includes parts similarity searches that is connected with BOM. 
	3. **aCAD model families**: will implement step-by-step based on priorities. 
		- **aCAD**: firstly, we need to finish the project aCAD for proof of concept.
		- **Library Search**: Search fragmented data, CAD, BOM, and assets based on library search. 
		- **Assembly**: conduct multi-parts, large scale assembly automatically.
		- **Auto-Constraint**: automatically recognizes and setup the constraints based on previous data. 
		- **aCAD**: Build parametric parts and product based on data. Needs to be fine-tuned rapidly tailored for each industry and enterprises. 
		- **Parametric Reasoning**: Chat and parametric reasoning for user ask based on "existing CAD models."
		- **DFM/DFA Copilot**: Check DFM/DFA compatibility, then modify based on its data.
		- **Pattern Generation**: Make pattern hole 
		- **Tolerance Optimzier**: 
		- **Topology Optimization**: 
		- **Compliance Copilot**: 
		- **Design & Engineering Specific Copilot**: 
		- **PLM Integration**:
	4. **CAE**: Everysim partnership
		- **Pre-Processing for Sim**: 
		- **Sim based design optimization**: 
7. **Our competitors**: Cool technology, but is it actually worth? 
	- **Fundraising & Rumors**: why it is important in macro-scale, why America, why most of greatest VC made this story, but THEY ARE OPERATING IN A WRONG DIRECTION. 
	- **Reason why they are going to wrong direction**:
		- **Wrong Consideration of Domain Characteristic**:  what industry requires is bigger than AI startups thought. The friction of ENTERPRISE ADOPTING AI TOOLs are huge. ==As long as it doesn't provide FAST, DIRECT PRODUCT GAIN, they won't buy it.== Most of CAD users are in tier 1 enterprises. THIS IS WHAT WE EXPERIENCED THROUGH Samsung and Hyundai. 
		- **Wrong Target**: For many AI startups including Zoo.Dev, AdamCAD, MacAgent, Gnuclius, Ndotlight, LeoAI etc, they have CAD AI renderer, but no CAD platform despite their massive B2C users. Without CAD platform, it is impossible to acquire high-quality data with massive B2C users, but ==becoming MUCH MORE COST-INTENSIVE business model==. NEED BACKDATA: their MRR etc
		- **Wrong Modality**: Both text and image is NOT a good way of representing 3D CAD model. Many of current CAD AI startups are having naive LLM approaches. Nevertheless, **vectors, mesh, NURBS are good modalities to manipulate 3D CAD**. Only Autodesk neural CAD tries CAD-friendly foundation model approach; recently some startups are doing foundation model as well. 
		- **Wrong direction to M&A**: their tech stack is NOT compatible for most cases. **==Seamless integration is CRITICAL==**, because ==**MOST OF CUSTOMERS ARE CORPORATE CAD DESIGNER/ENGINEERS**.== 
	- **Naive, live industry reactions to their platforms**: Zoo.Dev, AdamCAD, MacAgent, Gnuclius, Ndotlight, LeoAI.
8. **Reason why it's DOABLE**: 
	- **Great Case Study**: Spacemaker, an archi-AI startup where only had $5-10M Rev, but acquired by $240M valuation. [[Spacemaker_Case_Study]]. In terms of its MRR, we should just make ==$416K-833K/month==. 
	- **Reasonable Target Revenue**: the minimum ticket size for us is $100M, and to make that ,value with market promised multiple 15-40x. Based on Spacemaker case, making $5-10M Rev, $416K-833K/month made $240M M&A deal, which is totally reasonable to achieve. **By its definition of "valuation"**, that includes **future earnings potential and its intangible value, it is possible due to Dimension AI's scalability: with a few enterprise customers, generating revenue based on cutting-edge technology**, implying its **future revenue with more distribution will be much more impactful and profitable**. 
	- **Plug-In First GTM Strategy**: Autodesk's 97% of users are ANNUAL RECURRING SUBSCRIBERS, and there are no alternatives. If we make A FEW GOOD ENOUGH solution, selling product isn't that hard due to its great channel: clients have budget for CAD software and its plug-in. **It has less friction for well-made plug-ins, that can be seamlessly integrated into their current workflows.** 
	- **BM**: Pricing matters. We need to build 10x system for each workflows.
		- **Top-Down**: P x Q approach for each products
			- **MSA**: Core UI, Data Pipeline, key aCAD models, Ontology Powered Agent
			- **PSA**: providing domain/enterprise specific tools.
		- **Bottom-Up**: 
			- Per saving time pricing
			- Per project pricing
			- Pay-as-you-go model
	- **What we achieved**: is amazing. Samsung, HD Hyundai etc. 
		- Samsung: 3 retentions and 99/100 partner evaluation.
	- **ADVISOR BOARD**: AI, Manufacturing, Ontology, Data, GTM etc. 
9. **Summary**: 
	- **Market & Customer**: Autodesk YoY 15-17% avg, 90+% gross margin rate, 98% of users are annual recurring revenue, almost zero churn, total market share 63.55%, increased spent on R&D and M&A. 97% of Autodesk's customer is ==YEARLY RECURRING CUSTOMER==. If we build the product through Autodesk plug-in, and assume we take 1% of users, then we'll make minimum $5-10M ARR.
	- **Competitor**: all other competitors are not Autodesk friendly, due to their target customers, technologies, and tractions. 
		- They target hobbiest among corporate-heavy CAD industry
		- Their technology focuses on cool thing, not helpful thing
		- Very hard to make single revenue, but we made it. 
	- **Our Tech & GTM Strategy**: 
		- Autodesk demand AI product that fits with their ecosystem, due to internal/external pressure on AI. 
		- We target Autodesk's "**biggest revenue driver**," Revit, a product for architecture and interior domain.
		- **Make new revenue driver with new customer segments**: target Fusion 360 with new AI features. **Autodesk LT(light)**. Leveraging and leading them into upselling line-ups. 
		- **We complement Autodesk's AI demand**:
			- **High quality data shortage(for AI training)**: it's all clients' data. Due to data scarcity, they need a system that can generate numerous amount of data from small-scale, high quality data. 
			- **Neural CAD models**: build packages of industry specific foundation models that fits with 
			- **Data efficient agent system**: 
	- **Achievable Goal**:
		- Competitor got a wrong way on customer, failed value proposition. 
	- Financial Model:

**Q&As**
- Why don't current enterprise pay 1M? 
	- Be authentic to this question: we wandered, had to find PMF. 
	- Now, we finally started building recurring revenue with Hyundai.
- Why don't we have American customer? 
	- We have American customers. 
	- Focusing on archi/interior domain, and we've have exclusive partnership with Korean best interior consulting firm. 
	- We have B2B and B2C high-end customers. 
- What if Autodesk makes PLM agent? 
	- **There's no technical MOAT for PLM**: not competing with them. If that's better than ours? We'll just connect that into our CAD, empowering dependency on Dimension CAD AI more, that becomes more competitive with their PLM agent. 
- Which industry is the most CAD-heavy industry?
	- OR why did you get the market order like that?
