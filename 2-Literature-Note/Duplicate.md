# Post-Archion Product and Technology Roadmap (Revised)

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the revised post-Archion product and technology roadmap for The Dimension Company. This roadmap is designed to achieve a total of $10M in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and position the company for a strategic acquisition by Autodesk for over $200M.

This revised roadmap is based on the MVP ideas listed in the "M&A Storytelling Pager.md" file and is not limited to the architecture/interior domain. It focuses on high-impact, cross-domain products that will create a strong "data moat" and make The Dimension Company an attractive acquisition target for Autodesk.

The roadmap consists of a sequence of four new products that will be built on top of our core technology stack:

*   **STEP-GOT (Generative Object Tree):** A data protocol standard for AI-ready CAD models.
*   **Universal CAD Search:** An ontology-powered search engine for all CAD data.
*   **CAE On-Demand:** A platform for running CAE simulations on demand.
*   **ECO/ECN Automation:** A tool for automating engineering change orders.

## 2. Core Technology Stack

Our technology stack is designed to create a virtuous cycle of data acquisition, model improvement, and product innovation. It consists of three core components:

*   **Data Pipeline:** A scalable system for collecting, processing, and enriching proprietary data from our products and partners. This data will be used to train our AI models and will be a key strategic asset for acquisition.
*   **aGFL (agentic Geometry Figure Library):** A data-efficient, neural CAD foundation model for Text-to-CAD. aGFL will be the core of our product design and generation capabilities.
*   **Ontology Agent:** A tool-using agent for CAD-related tasks, powered by a knowledge graph that combines Bill of Materials (BOM), code, and metadata. The Ontology Agent will enable our products to perform complex, multi-step tasks and reason about design and engineering constraints.

## 3. Product Roadmap

### Archion (In CBT)

*   **Product:** An AI-powered interior design tool for 2D-to-3D conversion, FF&E placement, and photorealistic rendering.
*   **Target ARR:** $3M
*   **Strategic Role:** Validate the GTM strategy, establish a beachhead in the interior design market, and begin generating proprietary data.

### STEP-GOT (Post-Archion MVP 1)

*   **Product:** A data protocol standard for AI-ready CAD models. STEP-GOT will be a foundational technology that will enable the development of all other products. It will be an open standard, but we will provide proprietary tools and services for converting and enriching STEP-GOT data.
*   **Target ARR:** $1M
*   **Strategic Role:** Create a new standard for AI-ready CAD data, and position The Dimension Company as a leader in the field. This will be a key strategic asset for acquisition.

### Universal CAD Search (Post-Archion MVP 2)

*   **Product:** An ontology-powered search engine for all CAD data, including 3D models, drawings, and specifications. Users can search for data using natural language, images, or even sketches.
*   **Target ARR:** $3M
*   **Strategic Role:** Solve a major pain point for engineers and designers, and generate a massive amount of proprietary data on user preferences and product specifications. This data will be used to train our AI models and will be a key asset for acquisition.

### CAE On-Demand (Post-Archion MVP 3)

*   **Product:** A platform for running CAE simulations on demand. We will partner with existing CAE providers to offer a wide range of simulation capabilities. Our Ontology Agent will be used to automate the process of setting up and running simulations.
*   **Target ARR:** $2M
*   **Strategic Role:** Enter the high-growth CAE market and demonstrate the power of our Ontology Agent to automate complex, multi-step tasks.

### ECO/ECN Automation (Post-Archion MVP 4)

*   **Product:** A tool for automating engineering change orders, from impact analysis to drawing updates. Our Ontology Agent will be used to understand the relationships between different parts and assemblies, and to automatically update all affected documents.
*   **Target ARR:** $1Md
*   **Strategic Role:** Solve a major pain point for manufacturing companies and demonstrate the power of our Ontology Agent to automate complex, multi-step tasks.

## 6. Strategic Rationale for Autodesk M&A

This revised roadmap is designed to make The Dimension Company an even more irresistible acquisition target for Autodesk. Here's why:

*   **Cross-Domain Applicability:** The new roadmap is not limited to the architecture/interior domain. It addresses the needs of a wide range of industries, from manufacturing to aerospace.
*   **Data Moat:** Our products will generate a massive amount of proprietary data on user preferences, product specifications, and design decisions. This data will be invaluable to Autodesk for training their Neural CAD models.
*   **Data-Efficient AI:** Our aGFL model is designed to be data-efficient, which will be a major advantage for Autodesk as they struggle with data scarcity.
*   **Agentic AI:** Our Ontology Agent will demonstrate the power of agentic AI to automate and optimize the design process. This aligns perfectly with Autodesk's strategic focus on agentic AI.
*   **Strategic Fit:** Our focus on creating a new standard for AI-ready CAD data (STEP-GOT) and our entry into the high-growth CAE market will make us a highly strategic acquisition for Autodesk.
*   **Financials:** Our target of $10M ARR will make us a financially attractive acquisition target.

By executing on this roadmap, we will not only build a successful business, but also create a company that is strategically vital to the future of Autodesk.
