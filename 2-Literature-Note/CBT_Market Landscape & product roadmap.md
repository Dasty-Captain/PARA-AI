If you want, I can:
-  Convert this into a one-page strategy template,
-  Produce a prioritized checklist tailored to your industry (please tell me the industry and company stage),
-  Or draft specific sections (e.g., vision, 3-year financial plan, GTM) based on your inputs.

## Uncovered Areas: Uncertainty 
***
- **Still, lack diversity**: need more interview on “interior consulting housing, office, hotel, construction” domain.
- **Risk**: 
	- Interior Consulting Area
	- Furniture Area
	- Real Estate Dev Area 
	- Housing Interior & SMB
	- Large Architectural Enterprises 
	- (**Huge**) WHY DO THEY NEED 3D MODELING? For construction? or for what? Need interview.
