# Source Priority

## Load Order

1. User-provided paths, IDs, and links in the current request.
2. Local repo context (`.opencode/agents`, `.opencode/skills`, project docs).
3. Obsidian quick notes and related vault notes.
4. Web sources only when local sources are insufficient.

## By Route

### Notion-related
- Prioritize Notion page/database/data-source IDs and workspace links.
- Use local process docs before browser automation.

### Visualization
- Prioritize existing templates, diagrams, and source documents.
- Pull web references only for missing standards/examples.

### Deep Research
- Start with local materials and internal assumptions.
- Expand to external references for validation and contradiction.

### Thinking
- Prioritize user's goals, constraints, and existing notes.
- Add external context only if a key uncertainty remains.
