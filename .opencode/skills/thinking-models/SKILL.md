# Thinking Models

Use this skill to choose and apply the best thinking framework (or framework sequence) for the user's objective.

## Framework Catalog

Include and support all of the following:

- First Principles Thinking
- Minto Pyramid Principle
- HV Logic (Horizontal and Vertical Logic)
- Double Diamond
- Diverger and Converger (single diamond)
- Deep-dive
- SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer)
- SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat)
- HTDQ (Hero, Treasure, Dragon, Quest)
- 5 Whys
- 5W + H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How)
- Yes/No Flowchart
- Bezos 1-Way Door / 2-Way Door
- Devil's Advocate
- Logic Tree (with key drivers)
- Uncertainty-remover
- Teach me like 5 years old (ELI5)
- Scenario Planning (aggressive, realistic, conservative)

## Framework Selection Guide

Use this routing logic:

1. If the problem is vague, use `5W+H` then `SCQA`.
2. If root cause is unknown, use `5 Whys` and optionally `Logic Tree`.
3. If strategic posture is needed, use `SWOT` and `Scenario Planning`.
4. If innovation/discovery is needed, use `Double Diamond` or `Diverger/Converger`.
5. If decision reversibility matters, use `Bezos 1-way/2-way door`.
6. If argument quality is critical, use `Devil's Advocate` and `HV Logic`.
7. If communication clarity is critical, use `Minto Pyramid` and/or `SCQA`.
8. If uncertainty is high, use `Uncertainty-remover` plus scenario stress tests.
9. If the user asks for fundamentals, use `First Principles`.
10. If comprehension is low or mixed audience, add `ELI5` translation.
11. If motivation and narrative alignment are weak, use `HTDQ`.
12. If a binary operational path is needed, use `Yes/No Flowchart`.

## Required Behavior

- Select the minimum-sufficient framework set.
- If multiple frameworks are needed, sequence them clearly.
- Keep output decision-oriented, not theory-heavy.

## Required Inputs

- Objective or decision to make.
- Scope and constraints (time, resources, risk tolerance).
- Expected output type (analysis, plan, recommendation, explanation).

If inputs are missing, ask only for the minimum needed values.

## Framework Cards

For each model below, apply this structure:
- Purpose
- When to use
- Core steps
- Common pitfall

### First Principles Thinking
- Purpose: Derive solutions from fundamentals instead of analogy.
- When to use: Assumptions are stale or constraints feel artificial.
- Core steps: List assumptions -> challenge each assumption -> isolate irreducible facts(axioms) -> rebuild options from facts -> test.
- Common pitfall: Mistaking convention for principle.

### Minto Pyramid Principle
- Purpose: Communicate recommendations with top-down clarity.
- When to use: Executive briefs and decision memos.
- Core steps: Lead with answer -> group supporting points -> order points logically -> add selective evidence.
- Common pitfall: Burying the answer in background.

### HV Logic
- Purpose: Make argument structure coherent across and within levels.
- When to use: Narrative is confusing or arguments overlap.
- Core steps: Define top claim -> ensure vertical support from evidence -> ensure horizontal sibling logic (MECE where possible) -> remove overlaps.
- Common pitfall: Repetitive sibling points that do not advance the claim.

### Double Diamond
- Purpose: Separate problem-space exploration from solution-space execution.
- When to use: Ambiguous design/strategy challenges.
- Core steps: Discover -> Define -> Develop -> Deliver.
- Common pitfall: Jumping to solution before defining the real problem.

### Diverger/Converger (Single Diamond)
- Purpose: Generate broad options then narrow to a focused decision.
- When to use: One-stage decisions or short workshops.
- Core steps: Frame question -> diverge options -> cluster -> evaluate criteria -> converge.
- Common pitfall: Converging too early.

### Deep-dive
- Purpose: Investigate root causes and non-obvious drivers deeply.
- When to use: Recurring issues or high-stakes underperformance.
- Core steps: Define gap -> collect evidence -> map causes -> test hypotheses -> prioritize interventions.
- Common pitfall: Treating symptoms instead of causes.

### SCQA
- Purpose: Move from context to tension to answer.
- When to use: Recommendation narratives and executive communication.
- Core steps: Situation -> Complication -> Question -> Answer -> support.
- Common pitfall: Multiple questions and no single answer.

### SWOT
- Purpose: Diagnose internal and external strategic factors.
- When to use: Strategy formation, portfolio, market-entry planning.
- Core steps: List S/W/O/T -> prioritize by impact/probability -> derive strategic moves.
- Common pitfall: Static list with no prioritization or action.

### HTDQ (Hero, Treasure, Dragon, Quest)
- Purpose: Align teams through narrative strategy framing.
- When to use: Mission clarity is weak in ambiguous transformation work.
- Core steps: Define Hero -> define Treasure metric -> define Dragon -> define Quest options -> choose path.
- Common pitfall: Narrative without measurable outcomes.

### 5 Whys
- Purpose: Identify root causes through iterative questioning.
- When to use: Operational incidents and repeated process failures.
- Core steps: State problem -> ask why -> repeat on each answer -> identify controllable root cause -> define fix.
- Common pitfall: Stopping at blame, not process.

### 5W + H
- Purpose: Build a complete baseline understanding quickly.
- When to use: Early discovery, incident intake, problem framing.
- Core steps: Answer who/what/when/where/why/how -> mark unknowns -> resolve critical gaps.
- Common pitfall: Gathering facts without checking consistency.

### Yes/No Flowchart
- Purpose: Build deterministic decision paths for repeatable execution.
- When to use: SOPs, triage, policy routing, support workflows.
- Core steps: Define start/end -> create binary questions -> map yes/no branches -> test edge paths.
- Common pitfall: Non-binary questions that create ambiguity.

### Bezos 1-Way / 2-Way Door
- Purpose: Match decision speed and rigor to reversibility.
- When to use: Portfolio of fast and high-stakes decisions.
- Core steps: Classify decision -> fast-path reversible decisions -> increase rigor for irreversible decisions -> define revisit trigger.
- Common pitfall: Treating most decisions as irreversible.

### Devil's Advocate
- Purpose: Improve decisions by structured contradiction.
- When to use: Groupthink risk or overconfident consensus.
- Core steps: Assign challenger -> state strongest counter-case -> test evidence -> revise decision.
- Common pitfall: Personal conflict instead of analytical challenge.

### Logic Tree (Key Drivers)
- Purpose: Decompose outcomes into actionable drivers.
- When to use: KPI diagnosis, performance improvement, problem decomposition.
- Core steps: Define top metric/problem -> branch MECE drivers -> quantify contributions -> prioritize high-leverage drivers.
- Common pitfall: Overlapping or missing branches.

### Uncertainty-remover
- Purpose: Reduce risk by testing highest-impact unknowns first.
- When to use: New bets, product strategy, GTM, high ambiguity.
- Core steps: List assumptions -> rank impact x uncertainty -> design smallest valid test -> decide proceed/pivot/stop.
- Common pitfall: Large build before assumption testing.

### Teach me like 5 years old (ELI5)
- Purpose: Improve understanding through plain-language explanation.
- When to use: Mixed audiences or low clarity.
- Core steps: Explain simply -> remove jargon -> identify gaps -> refine explanation with examples.
- Common pitfall: Oversimplifying away key constraints.

### Scenario Planning (Aggressive/Realistic/Conservative)
- Purpose: Stress-test plans across different futures.
- When to use: Uncertain macro, demand, regulatory, or operational conditions.
- Core steps: Define key uncertainties -> build three scenario assumptions -> model outcomes -> define triggers and contingency actions.
- Common pitfall: Treating scenarios as predictions rather than planning tools.

## Output Format

Return in this exact section order:

1. Objective and Constraints
2. Structured Analysis
3. Risks, Assumptions, and Uncertainty
4. Next Actions

## Guardrails

- Do not use more frameworks than necessary.
- Do not hide uncertainty or weak evidence.
- Do not output recommendation without clear decision owner and next step.
