# Initial Thoughts
***
- **Goal**: to figure out VERY DETAILED ambiguity and risks to achieve Archion's revenue goal. Estimated time: 2 weeks for full ontology implementation and data integration. 
- **Done**: Set of questions to actually ask the right questions, and to figure out what is blocker. I'll send it to 은지, PO of Archion. 
- **Source/Context**: Archion workspaces and our manager sync meeting log. 

# TO-DOs
***

- [x] Get the missing primary sources (links/paths): Archion workspace doc + manager sync meeting log where Archion Search revenue was decided
- [ ] Hard questions for 은지 (deal + definition of revenue)
	- [x] Who is the paying customer for the $10K/month? (name/company, segment, buyer role)
	- [x] What is the contract type? (pilot fee vs subscription; monthly vs annual; seat/usage limits)
	- [x] What exactly counts as "hit $10K/month"? (signed, invoiced, cash-in, MRR recognized)
	- [x] What does "Mid of March" mean as a milestone? (signature date, go-live date, first invoice date)
	- [x] Who needs to approve/sign on their side (procurement/legal/IT)? What is the fastest-path close plan with dates?
	- [x] What is the cancellation/refund clause and minimum term? (risk of churn after 1 month)
	- [x] What is the promised deliverable in the proposal/SOW? Paste the exact acceptance language.
	- [x] If we miss quality, what is the fallback that still invoices (limited pilot scope, manual curation service, partial feature)?

- [ ] Hard questions for 은지 (scope freeze: what must ship by mid-March)
	- [x] Which pipeline pieces are required for the paid scope: CPLG? FCLG? ASG? FCELG? (must-have vs optional)
	- [x] What is the single must-win user flow for the customer (start-to-finish, 1 paragraph)?
	- [x] What UI surfaces must exist (Room view, Category view, edit/regenerate loop, export/share)?
	- [x] What constraints must be supported day-1 (budget range, style, brand constraints, dimensions/fit, availability)?
	- [x] What integrations are required (Archion backend, catalog DB, auth, payments, vendor links)?
	- [x] What is explicitly out-of-scope for this deal (write the cut list now to prevent scope creep)?

- [ ] Hard questions for 은지 (data + ontology: the real schedule risk)
	- [x] What catalog is the customer expecting (count of SKUs, categories, regions)? How many SKUs must be searchable to accept?
	- [x] What is the current source of truth for furniture data today (DB/spreadsheet/vendor feeds)? Who owns it?
	- [x] Which metadata fields are guaranteed vs missing: price, dimensions, style tags, brand, color/material, lead time, images, 3D models, purchase URL
	- [x] What % of SKUs have clean price + dimensions today (rough estimate is OK, but must be stated)
	- [ ] What is the minimal ontology schema we will commit to by mid-March (field list + enums), and what fields are best-effort?
	- [ ] What is the data update cadence needed (daily/weekly), and what breaks if data is stale?

- [ ] Hard questions for risk assessment (measurement + quality gates)
	- [ ] Baseline: how long does selection take today for the target user flow (minutes) and how will we measure it?
	- [ ] Define Mixpanel events precisely (event names + start/stop definition for "selection time")
	- [ ] What is the minimum acceptable quality bar for paid delivery: top-10 relevance pass rate, catalog coverage %, p95 latency
	- [ ] Who will label relevance and how many queries (e.g., 50-100) before go-live?
	- [ ] What is the p95 latency and cost budget per query (Gemini + rerank) that keeps gross margin sane?
	- [ ] What is the failure mode plan when search is wrong (user feedback loop, quick re-index, manual override)?

- [ ] Convert answers into a 1-page risk register (Impact x Likelihood x Time-to-detect) + an explicit go/no-go date 1 week before mid-March


# Reading & Provocation
***

## Reading
- `4-Quick-Note/OKR Risk Assessment.md`: revenue risk explicitly flagged; target: `Archion Search: $10K/month -> Mid of March`
- `.opencode/UniversalContext.md` (project `archion-search`): intended pipeline (CPLG/FCLG/ASG/FCELG), pgvector + rerank, KPI intent (selection time 90%+ reduction)
- `2-Literature-Note/Interior Design Workflow Process Map.md`: why this is valuable (FF&E selection + revisions are real time sinks)

Risk assessment lens: if any one of these is undefined, the plan is fake.
1) Deal truth (who pays, what acceptance language, what the deadline actually means)
2) Data truth (catalog coverage + required fields + ownership)
3) Measurement truth (what KPI is, how it is computed, what bar must pass)

Missing sources to fetch next (non-negotiable for specificity):
- Customer-facing proposal/SOW snippet that states deliverables + acceptance criteria for the $10K/month
- Manager sync log where DRIs + scope cut decisions were made
- Archion workspace doc that describes current catalog/data reality (counts, missing fields, update cadence)

## Provocation
- Creativity: What is the smallest “paid” version of Archion Search that still justifies $10K/month? Write it as: inputs → outputs → guarantee.
- Critical-thinking: Pick one: data coverage, relevance quality, or contract close. Which is the true critical path? Justify with dates.
- Memory: List 3 integration slip causes you’ve seen; for each, name a pre-commit check that would have caught it.
- Meta-cognition: Where are we hand-waving (catalog size, field completeness, who labels relevance, legal/procurement)? Write the missing artifact name for each hand-wave.


# Annotate & Note-Taking
***
1. Ask interior teacher how much they can "realistically" pay for us. 
2. Ask Eunji: does the data quality SATISFY designers' quality standard. 
3. What types of AI labeling tests did you conduct? 
4. Estimated timeline for remaining items. 
5. There's no ontology items this week: how it will go? 
	- what kinds of ontology backlogs will be made and left? 
	- what is estimated time for ontology backlogs
6. What is the main blocker right now?

You are daily-agent. Goal: make Archion Search $10K/month (mid-March) plan decision-grade by eliminating ambiguity and producing a risk register + close plan.

Context sources to use first:
- Obsidian: `4-Quick-Note/은지님 아키온 서치 관련 팔로우업 및 디테일 챙기기.md`, `4-Quick-Note/OKR Risk Assessment.md`
- Universal context: `.opencode/UniversalContext.md` (project `archion-search` pipeline + KPI intent)
- Notion (if deal/meeting log is not in Obsidian): search within OKR hub (`1a69fe64d759806a8576f8bae78108ae`) and related BD docs/backlogs (`1b29fe64d759809999c5ded327025c0d`, `2ca9fe64d75980c6b388c1156cec7afc`) for: "Archion Search", "아키온 서치", "은지", "manager sync", "$10K", "SOW", "proposal".

Deliverables (must produce today):
1) Deal truth (1 page): customer, contract type, what counts as $10K/month, what "mid-March" milestone means, acceptance criteria language, close plan timeline + owner.
2) Scope freeze (mid-March): must-have vs out-of-scope; map to pipeline components (CPLG/FCLG/ASG/FCELG) + required UI surfaces.
3) Data/ontology truth: catalog size target, required metadata fields, % completeness estimate, owner, update cadence; minimal ontology schema (field list + enums) to commit.
4) Measurement + quality gates: baseline, Mixpanel event definitions for selection time, top-10 relevance gate, coverage %, p95 latency, cost/query budget, labeling plan (who/when/how many queries).
5) Risk register: Impact x Likelihood x Time-to-detect; top 5 risks with mitigations + explicit go/no-go date (T-7 days from mid-March).

Execution plan:
- Use @context-engineer to locate proposal/SOW + manager sync meeting log + Archion workspace catalog doc (links/paths/IDs).
- Draft a concise message to Eunji (PO) that asks only the missing decision-grade items (acceptance language, catalog reality, close plan) and requests the 2-3 missing artifacts.
- After collecting answers, update this note’s # TO-DOs with finalized actions and hand off to @KG-updater to store stable facts (deal target, dates, owners, acceptance criteria, KPI definitions).

3. 지금까지 어떤 종류의 AI 라벨링/평가 테스트를 진행했는가?
4. 남아 있는 항목들의 예상 일정(ETA).
5. 이번 주에 ontology 항목이 없는데, 앞으로 어떻게 진행되는가?
	- 어떤 종류의 ontology 백로그가 생성되어 쌓이게 되는가?
