# Initial Thoughts
***
- Goal: Assess risk based on current OKR and find what to improve. 
- Done: co-planning until I said finished. 
- Source/Context: Notion OKR page

# TO-DOs
***

- [ ] Pull the current OKR scope: Q1 2026 company objective + linked team KRs; list owners/DRIs
- [ ] Define “risk” rubric for this review (Impact x Likelihood x Detectability) + red/yellow/green thresholds
- [ ] Resolve the biggest unknowns (tracking freshness): current MRR/cash-in today, KR definitions, last-updated dates
- [ ] Gap check each KR (Current vs Target vs time left) and write the 3–5 highest-leverage risks + leading indicators
- [ ] Stress-test mitigations (what changes this week): resourcing/priority swaps, scope cuts, metric definition, customer commitments
- [ ] Produce improvement plan: top bets, owners, next 7-day actions, and re-check cadence

# Reading & Provocation

## Reading
- Primary sources found in Notion:
  - OKR hub (index + embeds): https://www.notion.so/1a69fe64d759806a8576f8bae78108ae
  - Company objectives DB: https://www.notion.so/1a69fe64d75980eeba15c99b3e45d46a
  - Team goals/KRs DB: https://www.notion.so/1a69fe64d7598077af78c934c53664c7
- Current company objective appears to be Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar): ==monthly revenue 60,000,000 KRW== + fundraising, with explicit KR targets (MRR 0->60M KRW; fundraising prep->seed) and a written risk register + mitigations:
  - https://www.notion.so/2b89fe64d759804da29fe338b0033494
- Progress signal quality is mixed: ==some team KRs have quantified progress== (e.g., a delivery KR at 54% vs 80% target by Feb end), ==while several revenue/fundraising KRs show 0/blank “Current”== values (tracking freshness is itself a material risk)
- Adjacent strategy context to sanity-check timelines and definitions:
  - https://www.notion.so/3029fe64d759803e9799c4a16c99bf76

Best-available lens for risk assessment (until numbers are refreshed): treat unknown/blank current as high uncertainty; prioritize resolving measurement + leading indicators first, then execution risks.

Missing sources most worth fetching next (to make this decision-grade):
- Single source of truth for revenue/MRR numbers (dashboard/report) + owner
- Fundraising pipeline artifact (CRM / investor list / scheduled meetings) + clear “done” definition
- Customer commitments for pilots/contracts (signed vs verbal) + acceptance criteria tied to technical KRs
- Resourcing/priorities (who is on Canvas vs D2G vs other milestones) to validate schedule realism

## Provocation
- Creativity: If you had to hit the same objective with 50% fewer engineering hours, what 3 scope cuts would you make and what 3 leading indicators would you track daily?
- Critical-thinking: Which single assumption, if false, collapses the entire Q1 plan? Write it as a falsifiable statement and design the smallest test.
- Memory: List the last 2–3 OKRs that were stopped/reset; what early warning signs were present before the reset?
- Meta-cognition: Where are you most likely overconfident (revenue, schedule, model quality, fundraising)? Assign a confidence % and name the evidence you’re missing.

# Annotate & Note-Taking
***
- Is the revenue "really" achievable? 
	- YES. BUT NEED ACTUAL CONTRACT UNTIL THAT TIME. 
- Is the Biz Dev KR right? Can this be qualitatively evaluated? 
	- NO. Need to change: 
		- Should set up the numbers for: aCAD data-pipeline 
		- fundraising & grant: $3M -> GPU(need to evaluate how much we'll get based on this)
- Prioritize and define what "we really need for fundraising"
	- need to prioritize ALL projects
- Ambiguity
	- Revenue: can we get the contract until that time? 
		- Archion Search: $10K/month -> Mid of March
		- DN: $30K/month -> Mid of March
		- LIG: $30K/month -> Mid of March
		- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries: $12K/month -> Early March
		- HD Hyundai: N/A -> Mid of March
		- Samsung Eletronics: N/A -> Early March
		- Volvo: N/A -> should contact again 
		- HP: N/A -> should contact again 
		- Sony: N/A -> should contact again
	- Tech & Product: can we really achieve the benchmark we setup? Pretty confident. 
		- Archion: YES(Canvas maybe)
		- aCAD: YES
		- D2C: Maybe
		- C2D: YES
