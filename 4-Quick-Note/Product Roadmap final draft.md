# Initial Thoughts
***
- **Goal**: I'm trying to finalize the drafts of our product and pricing roadmap. There may be a lot of different components as well. Your task is 1) to find the points that are different or contradictory 2) and become a devil's advocate about the roadmaps 
- **Done**: Be a creative, co-planner as a devil's advocate, to stimulate my thoughts and defend VCs' critical questions. 
- **Source/Context**:

# TO-DOs
***
- [ ] **First - Build a contradiction table (Pricing vs Product)**: capture 10 tensions with exact evidence lines and severity (High/Med/Low).
- [ ] **First - Validate Q1->Q2 conversion logic**: test whether pilot/SI terms can realistically convert to `$250K/yr` platform floor without churn.
- [ ] **Next - Rebuild 2026 revenue bottom-up**: tie each quarter target (`$80K -> $150K -> $390K -> $540K MRR`) to named accounts, stage, close date, and probability.
- [ ] **Next - Prove unit economics under included credits**: model margin sensitivity for token allowance burn (`$40/$100 per 1M`) across SMB and Tier-1 usage profiles.
- [ ] **Next - Stress-test capacity constraints**: map module shipping + enterprise deployment + fundraising load by owner to expose impossible parallel work.
- [ ] **Next - Prepare investor defense pack**: for each high-severity contradiction, add one hard evidence artifact (contract, cohort data, signed LOI, pipeline screenshot).
- [ ] **Last - Create scenario plan**: conservative / realistic / aggressive cases with explicit trigger points for hiring, scope cuts, and fundraising narrative changes.

# Reading & Provocation

## Reading

### Source Pack (read and compared)
- Pricing Final Draft: https://www.notion.so/3029fe64d759808b908be4e0a35a070a
- Product Roadmap (Dimension 2026 Timeline): https://www.notion.so/3029fe64d759803e9799c4a16c99bf76

### Critical contradictions for fundraising diligence
- **Price step-change risk (High)**: Q1 says Tier-1 runs on pilot/SI with no platform fee, then Q2 expects conversion into `$250K/yr` platform floor + seat + credits. This is the #1 churn/renegotiation risk in your model.
- **Lighthouse discount precedent risk (High)**: you state minimum annual commit around `$400K ARR`, while a lighthouse example is deeply discounted/at-cost; investors will ask if this anchors all enterprise deals down.
- **Packaging clarity risk (Med-High)**: "all modules included" message conflicts with monetization through platform + seats + credits + module-linked ACV expansion. This can look like price architecture is still unstable.
- **Execution compression risk (High)**: revenue jump from `$150K` to `$390K MRR` while shipping major modules in same window implies both product and enterprise sales cycles compress simultaneously.
- **Channel concentration risk (High)**: Q2 growth depends heavily on P&P advisory contribution (`$100K+ MRR` claim). Missing proof here weakens forecast credibility.
- **Bandwidth dilution risk (Med-High)**: roadmap runs module launches, enterprise deployment, partnerships, fundraising, and strategic optionality in parallel; investors will haircut plans for this.

### Draft investor-readiness lens (devil's advocate)
- Your core fragility is not product ambition; ==[^1]it is **commercial conversion math under execution load**.==
- If you cannot prove pilot->floor conversion and margin durability, Q2-Q4 revenue targets will be treated as narrative, not operating forecast.
- Immediate defense priority: ==[^2]move from claim-based roadmap to artifact-based proof (signed terms, pipeline stages, cohort outcomes, unit economics sensitivity).==

### Most valuable missing sources to fetch next
[^3]- ==Signed pilot contracts + conversion clauses (especially HD Hyundai/MHI/Volvo).==
- ==Actual pipeline report with stage probabilities and expected close dates.==
- Unit economics sheet: included-credit usage vs COGS by segment/account type.
- Current pricebook/SKU mapping and 2-3 anonymized order forms.

## Provocation
- Creativity: Design 3 packaging architectures that remove the Q1->Q2 price shock; choose one and state what revenue you sacrifice to reduce conversion risk.
- ==Critical-thinking: Pick your single weakest assumption (`conversion rate`, `sales cycle`, `margin`, or `delivery capacity`) and write 5 disconfirming tests that could kill it in 30 days.==[^4]
- Memory: List 3 past deals where discounting or custom terms created future precedent pain; what exact clause would you add now to prevent repeat damage?
- Meta-cognition: ==Where are you confusing ambition with evidence?==[^5] Mark each Q2-Q4 target as {evidence-backed, inference, hope} and justify in one line.
- Investor gauntlet (fundraising):
  - Why should pilot customers accept a sudden jump to platform-floor economics in one quarter?
  - ==What is your downside case if P&P contributes only half of expected pipeline?==[^6]
  - Which quarter target survives if module shipment slips by 6 weeks?
  - What proof makes the `$500K+ ACV` flagship target credible now, not aspirational?
  - What exactly do you cut first when capacity and roadmap promises conflict?

[^1]: revenue conversion is critical factors for our roadmap and should be able to convince investors with solid logic: 
	1. ==domain-specific consulting firm's power==: they need new revenue driver and we also need to reduce GTM cost and time. It's win-win relationship. It's consulting firms' current customers, and it's much easier to implement the paid pilot test through them. 
	2. ==FOMO with mega trend==: manufacturing industry is more than 2 centuries, and it's still on-going. Therefore, opportunities for innovation is massive. 2 key mega trends are digital transformation and AI transformation, and Dimension's solution qualifies both quality standards. 

[^2]: This is very important point: ==investors doesn't believe the claim, but numbers.== 

[^3]: Agree: need to build how our sales pipeline currently work and where they are. 

[^4]: TODOs: I need to list up all weak assumptions.

[^5]: Need to list up all confidence scores for projects.

[^6]: We'll have another consulting firms globally. They focus on Korea as a PLM-specific consulting firm.
