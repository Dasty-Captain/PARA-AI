# Notion vs. Obsidian: The Dual-Brain Workflow for the Agentic Founder
***
## Summary
> [!quote] 
> To maximize productivity, establish a strict functional split: **Notion for Execution (The Outer Brain)** and **Obsidian for Ideation (The Inner Brain)**. Connect them via an **Agentic Loop** using OpenCode.

## The Dual-Brain Architecture
***
### 1. Notion: The Executive Dashboard (Action)
- **Purpose**: Managing the "Intelligence Production Line" and team operations.
- **Usage**: Use for anything with a **status**, **assignee**, or **deadline**.
- **Key Assets**: Project Scrum (Sprints), CRM (SAFE round tracking), and Collaborative PRDs.
- **Founder Rule**: If it's a task, it belongs in Notion.

### 2. Obsidian: The Research Engine (Insight)
- **Purpose**: Deep thinking, technical strategy, and Zettelkasten synthesis.
- **Usage**: Permanent knowledge that compounds over time.
- **Key Assets**: Atomic Permanent Notes, Maps of Content (MOC), and strategic mapping via Graphiti.
- **Founder Rule**: If it's an insight you want to keep forever, it belongs in Obsidian.

## The Agentic Loop (The Bridge)
***
The connection between these two systems is managed by **OpenCode Sub-Agents**:
1. **@atomizer**: Pulls raw notes from Notion/Inbox and extracts atomic ideas into Obsidian's `Permanent Note/` folder.
2. **@librarian**: Audits the Obsidian graph to ensure semantic linking (Conceptual, Practical, Contrasting) and strategic alignment.
3. **@vibe-agent**: Executes technical tasks (coding/specs) based on the "Action Items" defined in Notion.

## Recommended Workflow Pattern
- **Capture (Notion)** -> **Process (Obsidian @atomizer)** -> **Synthesize (Graphiti @librarian)** -> **Execute (OpenCode @vibe-agent)**.
