1. How I spent a year: retrospective of 2025
	- 2025 was empty, wandering, painful year. 
	- I lost many things: faith, purity, passion, fire, people etc.
	- Everything I needed and focused was her, and she has gone just as like vape. 
	- It's time for recover. I need to redeem things I lost. 
	- I wasn't able to keep anything in my hands, even for things that I treated like treasure. I lost everything.
	- I couldn't be great person, couldn't grow up in faith, only lost. 
	- Resentful, bitter, and only bloody mind.
	- '25 lessons: 
		- relationship affects more than I thought

		- time flies
		- we are already on high standard from global POV
		- never trust human
		- it's always worth trying hard and doing the best
		- even though everything looks dirty
		- there's always novel minds
		- need to desperately defy gravity all the time
		- responsibility matters: it's meaningful
		- mindset is everything
